# Power BI Survey Analysis Project  

This project marks my first step into Power BI, where I analyzed survey data to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. Inspired by **Alex The Analyst**’s beginner-friendly tutorial, I personalized the project by redesigning the dashboard and rethinking the analysis approach to gain a deeper learning experience.  

## Key Insights  
The dashboard provides the following insights from the survey data:  
- 📊 **Number of respondents** and their **average age**  
- 💰 **Average salaries** segmented by roles  
- 📈 **Industry distribution** using a ribbon chart  
- 🌍 Respondents' **country breakdown** represented with a donut chart  
- 🔄 Insights on **profession switches** to data-related roles by gender  
- 🏆 **Job expectations** and challenges in working with data (waterfall chart)  

## Learning Highlights  
- Customized dashboard design to improve aesthetics and usability.  
- Enhanced my understanding of Power BI’s visualization tools and techniques.  
- Reinforced the importance of **learning by doing** by adapting and iterating on tutorial content.  

## Tools Used  
- **Power BI** for data analysis and visualization.  

## About the Project  
While this is a beginner-level project, it was an excellent introduction to creating data-driven insights and dashboards. Experimenting with formats, themes, and layouts helped me develop foundational skills in data storytelling.  

Feel free to explore the files and share your feedback! This project is just the beginning of my journey, and I’m excited to continue learning and growing in the field of data analytics.
